# GetFlags
This looks on a data set pulled from a DB of captured Pump and Tank Guages to see if there are any leaks on site.
This was a very messy project done over a few Weeks designed to test the capability of technology that we purchased. 
I havent completed the software to remove false flags.

Should you require an example of dataset let me know I will provide one.
